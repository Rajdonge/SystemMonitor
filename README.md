Log Monitoring Script

Overview

This script reads a log file, checks for suspicious patterns, and prints alerts if any are found. It scans for specific keywords indicating potential security threats and extracts timestamps from the log entries.

Features

🚨 Detects suspicious log entries such as failed login attempts, unauthorized access, and malicious activity.

⏰ Extracts timestamps from log entries if available.

⚠️ Displays alerts with the detected issue and the corresponding timestamp.

🛠 Handles errors gracefully, including file not found exceptions.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Installation

📥 Clone this repository or copy the script to your local machine.

✅ Ensure you have Python installed.

Usage

1️⃣ Prepare a log file (e.g., file1.txt) with log entries in the following format:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS Log entry message

Example log file content:

2024-12-22 11:00:15 Unauthorized access detected in database server
2024-12-22 12:15:30 Malicious activity detected: Suspicious script execution

2️⃣ Run the script:

python log_monitor.py

Expected Output

If any suspicious activity is detected, the script prints alerts like this:

🚨 ALERT: failed login DETECTED AT 2024-12-22 10:45:00
🚨 ALERT: unauthorized access DETECTED AT 2024-12-22 11:00:15
🚨 ALERT: malicious activity detected DETECTED AT 2024-12-22 12:15:30

Error Handling

❌ If the log file is missing, an error message is displayed:

ERROR: Log file not found at file1.txt

⚠️ If any other error occurs, the script displays an appropriate error message.
